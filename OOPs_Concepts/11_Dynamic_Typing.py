#Program to understand Dynamic Typing 

#here x is just a name to memory i.e there is no data type as int
x = 5
print(id(x))#print the address of x
print(type(x))#print the data type of value point by x i.e int 

#change the x to point to string 
x = "shobhit"
print(id(x))#print the address of x
print(type(x))#print the data type of value point by x i.e str
